ExampleCommand
==============

A very simple usage of the Groff/Command package. Intended to be checked out to quickly start new PHP command line projects.

To use:

`git clone git@github.com:agroff/ExampleCommand.git ProjectName`

`cd ProjectName`

`composer update`

`chmod +x run.php`

`./run.php --name FirstName`

Alternatively, you may need to do:

`php run.php --name FirstName`

From there, just edit this to do what you want it to, edit the composer file, change the git remote origin and push to
 where ever your project is stored.
